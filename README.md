# Surface-Integral-Plotter
[Python] A short script to create 3d visualisations of 2D functions using pythons matplotlib package.
Originally created to plot surface integrals, hence the name.
Note code does not compute integrals.

Takes command line inputs for the bounds of the 2 variable function.
Inputs taken as integers. 

Example;

run FileName.py A B C D E

A is the lower bound of var 1
B is the upper bound of var 1
C is the lower bound of var 2
D is the upper bound of var 2
E is the scale of the Z axis, scale is E time max Z value.

Inputted function to be entered into the source code.
